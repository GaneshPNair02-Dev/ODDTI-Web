## 🎯 About the Game

**ODDTI™** (read as *Oddity*) is a digital recreation of one of India’s simplest yet most beloved childhood games — **Odd/Even Hand Cricket**.  
What began as a quick bench-top pastime among school friends has been transformed into a fully functional browser game, built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This web edition is part of the larger ODDTI project family, alongside the **Python/TI-84 Edition** and **Predictor Edition**, developed by **⚡GPN⚡** as a bridge between nostalgic fun and structured logic.

## 🧩 Game Concept

The logic follows the same charm as the playground version:

1. **Toss Phase** – Pick *Odd* or *Even*, and a number between **0–6**.  
   The sum of your number and the CPU’s number decides the winner.  
2. **Batting Phase** – Enter a number (0–6).  
   If your number matches the CPU’s, you’re out. Otherwise, you score runs equal to your number.  
3. **Bowling Phase** – Reverse the roles!  
   The CPU bats while you bowl, using the same logic.  
4. **Win Conditions** –  
   - Beat the target → 🏆 You win  
   - Equal target → 🤝 Tie  
   - Out before target → 💥 Lose  

Simple. Logical. Nostalgic.
